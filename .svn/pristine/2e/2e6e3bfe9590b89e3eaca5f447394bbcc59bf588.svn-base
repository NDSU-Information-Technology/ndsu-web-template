## Running Gulp tasks for development

Styles are written using SCSS preprocessor. `NodeJS` is required to compile SCSS to CSS. It is advised to use provided `gulp` tasks to automate build as well as to enable `browsersync`.

Make sure to have `gulp` installed globally on your machine.

`npm install gulp -g`

In the directory, run the `install` command to install all dependencies.

`npm install`

And finally, run the task `serve` to begin `browsersync`.

`gulp serve`

Your default browser should launch `localhost:3000` and open the default page for the development (*template.html*). All changes to *.html* and *.scss* will be refreshed automatically by `browsersync`.
