The work is being conducted in conjunction with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who is helping to mentor the student participants and supervised locally by Computer Science Asst. Prof. Jeremy Straub.",

Oliveira of the University of Porto in Portugal and Maximilian M. Etschmaier of San Diego State University. The theme of the special issue concerns the relationships between humans and autonomous or semi-autonomous systems. Given the rise of artificial intelligence, and deep learning in particular, the argument for systems to carry out autonomous actions with little or no human involvement becomes more compelling. The ethical, social, and legal issues that arise involve the concept of system trust, which is intertwined with cybersecurity. The special issue of the Journal will be available in December of 2017.",
